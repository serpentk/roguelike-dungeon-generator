# roguelike-dungeon-generator

This crate provides an abstract interface for roguelike dungeon generator and some generator implementations

## ToDo

 - [x] Binary Space Partition tree based generator
 - [x] Depth First Search based generator
 - [x] Cellular Automata based generator
 - [ ] Agent Modeling based generator
 - [ ] Generative Grammars based generator
 - [ ] Delaunay Triangulation  and Minimal Spanning Tree based generator from Reddit (maybe it's better not to implement this one)
